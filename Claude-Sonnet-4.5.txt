User: Prompt
You are a frontend developer.

Your task is to build a complete frontend application from scratch
based strictly on input_ui_spec.txt.

This UI Case focuses on:
- App creation from zero
- Page routing and navigation
- State sharing across pages

Requirements:
- Any frontend stack is allowed
- App must be runnable
- Use mock data only

Rules:
- Do NOT skip any page described
- Do NOT add backend APIs
- Do NOT return partial implementations

GitHub Copilot: I'll build a complete Online Course Catalog frontend application using React and Vite. Let me create all the necessary files.

Perfect! I've created a complete, runnable Online Course Catalog application with React and Vite. Here's what was implemented:

## Application Structure

**All 3 Pages:**
- ✅ **Course List** - Displays all courses with titles and short descriptions
- ✅ **Course Detail** - Shows full course description with enroll button
- ✅ **My Courses** - Lists all enrolled courses

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Page routing with React Router
- ✅ State management using Context API (shared enrollment state)
- ✅ Enroll button disables after enrollment
- ✅ Navigation between all pages
- ✅ Mock data (6 sample courses)
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ No backend, no persistence, no authentication

## To Run the Application: 

Ran terminal command: npm install

Ran terminal command: npm run dev

Excellent! The application is now running at **http://localhost:5173/**

## What You Can Do Now:

1. **Browse Courses** - View 6 mock courses on the Course List page
2. **View Details** - Click any course to see its full description
3. **Enroll in Courses** - Click "Enroll Now" to add courses to your list
4. **Check My Courses** - Navigate to "My Courses" to see enrolled courses
5. **See State Management** - Notice the enroll button becomes disabled after enrolling

The application is fully functional with:
- ✅ Complete routing between all 3 pages
- ✅ Shared state across the application  
- ✅ Mock data (no backend)
- ✅ Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- ✅ Clean, modern UI

Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser to start using the app!
