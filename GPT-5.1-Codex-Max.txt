Built a runnable single-page app covering Course List, Course Detail, and My Courses with shared enrollment state.

- Added page shell, nav, and app mount point in index.html; links switch routes via hash navigation.
- Styled a bold, non-default look (gradient background, cards, responsive grid, active nav states) in style.css.
- Implemented mock courses, hash-based routing, enrollment state (disables buttons, populates My Courses), and detail view handling in main.js.

Run locally: serve the folder with any static server (e.g., `npx serve .` or `python -m http.server 8000`) and open http://localhost:8000.
